Derpnet Meeting Minutes - Friday, February 25 2011
Attendence: George, Shidash, Robbie, Kit, Colin, Gareth

Robbie: Got Psychatog up and running, look on Git for connection information
Please talk to him to get an account if you haven't yet

Colin: Server is now an extremely minimal chatserver! This means we can start up working on basic framework kinds of things. Just need to make the socket server code have a good modular interface.

Note: For anyone who is confused about OTR: It is an encryption scheme which ensures:
- identity of both conversants
- all messages are going through unaltered (no man-in-the-middle after key authentication)
- after the fact, both conversants have absolute deniability
