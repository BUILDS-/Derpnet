For the Derpnet IRC server project.

The folder docs contains the new set of RFCs for IRC (numbers 2810-2813). The old
RFC (number 1459) is superceded by these.  In addition, our own technical
documents are in this folder.

We have an IRC channel: #derpnet at irc.foonetic.net. Our faithful bot DerpBot
will tell us whenever someone pushes an update.

Open source implementations that we have found should be added here:
An incomplete Haskell implementation:

WE HAVE MIGRATED TO AUTOTOOLS. Here are the important consequences of this:

We are now using a non-recursive autoconf/automake. You should edit Makefile.am
and configure.ac ONLY--- not Makefile itself. That is a scary thing. After
doing so, before you commit, run 'make clean.' That will propagate the changes
from those two files to the rest of the important ones. Please look especially
at Makefile.am, as most of it is pretty simple, and important, if you change
the structure of the source.

Secondly, we now have NEWS and ChangeLog. I'm going to say that we should
probably let ChangeLog be empty until we're at the point where we're making
small, organized changes. NEWS is a good place to put what you're doing.

Also, style things:

All .h files should be wrapped in #ifndef #endif, as all currently are.

I've grouped includes by class: First, system things outside of Derpnet.
Second, files within Derpnet that are NOT in the current folder (and thus use
<> instead of "" --- important!). Third, other files in the same folder, which
should always use "". Fourth, the file's own header.
